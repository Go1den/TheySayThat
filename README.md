They say that given a spoiler log from one of several popular randomizers (Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, and Donkey Kong 64), this program allows you to output the contents of hints you've discovered during a playthrough to a text file. If that file is then read by streaming software, it can be displayed on stream in real time, allowing viewers to know all of the hints you've received so far.

The program has been abstracted to allow support for any video game with a very small Python class definition required to add support.
