# TheySayThat - ZOOTR Gossip Stone Display
Given a spoiler log from a ZOOTR seed, this program allows you to output the contents of the Gossip Stones to a text file as you discover them. If that file is then read by streaming software, it can be displayed on stream in real time, allowing viewers to know all of the Gossip Stone text that has been read so far.
