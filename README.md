They say that given a spoiler log from one of several popular randomizers, this program allows you to output the contents of hints you've discovered during a playthrough to a text file. If that file is then read by streaming software, it can be displayed on stream in real time, allowing viewers to know all the hints you've received so far.

**Supported Games:**  
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time  
The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask  
Donkey Kong 64  
Metroid Prime  

The program has been abstracted to allow support for any video game with a very small Python class definition required to add support. The only requirement is that the game needs a spoiler log that can be consistently parsed to obtain the hint information.

Note: This has only been tested on Windows 10. Try it elsewhere at your own risk.
